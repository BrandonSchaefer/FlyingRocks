Animation:
    - Need to setup animations for destroyed ship and asteroids
    - Need a second VectorLine of the ship with flame out of the back with thruster on

Rotation of VectorLines:
    - Need to rotate around the middle of the VectorLine (such as ship/asteroid).
        Currently it looks bad

Score:
    - Need to draw the score and keep track of it

Lifes:
    - Need to add lifes, keep track of it and handle the logic


BUGS:
    - Currently when close to wrapping the asteroid will get stuck on the edge of the window
      and not warp to the other side (even with vel that *should* get there). I assume some
      rounding issue somewhere.
