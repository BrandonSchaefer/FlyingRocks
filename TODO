Animation:
    - Need to setup animations for destroyed ship and asteroids
    - Need a second VectorLine of the ship with flame out of the back with thruster on

Score:
    - Need to draw the score and keep track of it
    - Large = 25, Medium = 50, Small = 100

Lifes:
    - Need to add lifes, keep track of it and handle the logic

UFO:
    - Need to add a ufo computer in

Sound:
    - Need to add sound effects

UI:
    - Need to finish up the user interface for score + lifes and menus

Asteroids:
    - Need to fix the spawn points (they can spawn in a ship atm)
    - Need to pick a different asteroid when it gets destroyed

Scale:
    - Since all the objects are very small to start with Ill need to come up
      with a good scale factor based on the screen width/height to maintain
      consistent sizes (as well as removing hard coded values)

Collision:
    - Need to do better here, generating a rectangle for a complex vector line
      gives poor collision boxes
